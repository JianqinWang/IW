Assumptions:
Input format for p_data is as follows:
      int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4,
      	  	     5, 6, 7, 8,
		     9, 10, 11, 12};

which is a matrix with 3 rows and 4 columns, but declared as a 1D array.

Assumed all values in matrix are integers.

Assumed that negative integers are acceptable, that it is not empty space underneath the chess board.
